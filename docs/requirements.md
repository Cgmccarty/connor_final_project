# Bootcamp Final Project

<!--Dark Souls Build Generator-->

## Objective
- I want to generate builds based on how the user would like to play the game.
- I want to provide a place to save builds, generate new or random ones, and find another player's build.
- I want to help create challenges for experienced players with the random build generator.


## Users
- Anyone who plays Dark Souls 3 (would like to expand to all 3 Dark Souls games)


## What am I solving?
- Having a place to store, and easily access your past, current, and future character builds.


## Files/Directories
- WIP File Hierarchy (will be altered and refined as project progresses)


## Design Objectives
- Dark Souls atmosphere (gloomy, oppressed, death, holy, magic, fire, medieval)
- Bonfire animated page background
- Smooth site navigation, easy UI with good documentation on how to operate
- Links for walkthroughs, decision trees, NPC side stories

## Data
- Input
  1. Build names
  2. Character class
  3. Character gender
  4. Soul level for ideal build (if none is provided generate one with 120 soul level)
  5. Preferred value for any stat (or random if none)
  6. Preferred equipment

- Output
  1. Will show all input data, formatted into table-like view, and non-specified values will be randomly generated
